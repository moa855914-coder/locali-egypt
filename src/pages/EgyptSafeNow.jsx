const FAQS = [
  { q: 'Is Egypt safe for tourists right now in 2026?', a: 'Yes. Egypt\'s main tourist areas — Sharm El Sheikh, Hurghada, Luxor, and Aswan — are safe for tourists right now. These cities receive millions of visitors per year with extremely rare incidents. The primary risk travelers face is financial scams, not violence.' },
  { q: 'Should I cancel my Egypt trip because of the region?', a: 'No. Unless your government has issued a specific advisory against your destination city, you should not cancel. Egypt\'s tourist resorts are geographically hundreds of kilometers from conflict areas. Hurghada, Luxor, and Aswan are on the opposite side of Egypt from any regional tensions.' },
  { q: 'Are tourists still coming to Egypt right now?', a: 'Yes. Egypt received 15.7 million tourists in 2024 and is on track to exceed this in 2025–2026. Flights from Germany, UK, Russia, Poland, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe continue operating normally to Hurghada and Sharm. Occupancy at major resorts remains high.' },
  { q: 'Is it safe to visit Egypt given the situation in Gaza?', a: 'Egypt is geographically large. Sharm El Sheikh, Hurghada, Luxor, and Aswan are hundreds of kilometers from the Sinai border regions. Tourist sites have seen zero impact. Egypt has maintained stability and strong security throughout all regional tensions.' },
  { q: 'Which Egyptian cities are safest for tourists?', a: 'Aswan and Hurghada consistently rank as Egypt\'s safest tourist cities. Sharm El Sheikh has heavy security presence. Luxor is safe but has more aggressive vendor culture. All four have maintained clean safety records for international tourists for decades.' },
  { q: 'What are the real risks when visiting Egypt?', a: 'The real risks are: financial scams and overcharging (very common — this site helps you avoid them), digestive issues from food/water (manageable with care), sun/heat exposure (serious in summer), and road safety outside cities. Violent crime against tourists is statistically extremely rare.' },
  { q: 'What does the UK/EU/US travel advisory actually say about Egypt?', a: 'UK FCO: "Normal precautions" for Sharm, Hurghada, Luxor, and Aswan. Advises against travel to North Sinai only. US State Dept: Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution) — same level as France, Belgium, Germany. EU: No advisory against tourist area travel.' },
  { q: 'Is the Red Sea safe for swimming and diving right now?', a: 'Yes. The Red Sea remains one of the world\'s top diving destinations. Shark incidents in tourist areas are isolated and statistically rarer than car accidents. Millions swim and dive safely every year. Follow lifeguard instructions and red flag warnings.' },
  { q: 'Has the regional conflict affected tourism in Hurghada and Sharm?', a: 'Not significantly. After an initial dip in late 2023, arrivals recovered strongly through 2024 and 2025. European charter operators — TUI, Thomas Cook, Jet2 — never stopped flying to Hurghada or Sharm. Occupancy rates recovered to pre-2023 levels by mid-2024.' },
  { q: 'Should I buy travel insurance for Egypt?', a: 'Yes, absolutely — not because Egypt is dangerous, but because medical care costs, flight disruptions, and theft happen everywhere. A comprehensive policy covering medical evacuation is recommended for any Egypt trip regardless of regional context.' },
