    { q: 'Is it safe to swim in the Red Sea in Sharm?', a: 'Yes, at designated beach areas with lifeguards. Always respect red flags and lifeguard instructions. Currents and marine hazards (sea urchins, fire coral) are real. Never swim at unpatrolled beaches.' },
    { q: 'Is Sharm El Sheikh safe for solo female travelers?', a: 'The resort areas and Naama Bay are relatively safe for solo women. Avoid walking alone late at night in non-tourist areas. Verbal harassment exists but violent incidents against tourists are rare.' },
    { q: 'What should I do if I\'m scammed in Sharm?', a: 'Report to the Tourist Police (126 toll-free). They take tourist complaints seriously and exist specifically for this. File a report even if you don\'t expect recovery — it creates a record.' },
    { q: 'Is it safe to go to the desert near Sharm?', a: 'Yes, for organized tours with licensed operators. Do not go into the Sinai desert independently. Always tell your hotel where you are going and when you expect to return.' },
  ],
  hurghada: [
    { q: 'Is Hurghada safe in 2025?', a: 'Yes. Hurghada has an excellent safety record for tourists. The main tourist areas are well-patrolled. The primary risk is financial scams, not violent crime.' },
    { q: 'Are there sharks in Hurghada?', a: 'Shark encounters are extremely rare in tourist areas. There have been very isolated incidents. Standard safety: do not swim near fishing boats or at night, and do not bleed in the water.' },
    { q: 'Is Hurghada safe for women traveling alone?', a: 'Yes, particularly in the Marina, Sahl Hasheesh, and resort areas. These are well-lit, well-patrolled, and have international visitors constantly. Standard caution applies at night.' },
    { q: 'What is the emergency number in Hurghada?', a: 'Tourist Police: 126 (free). Ambulance: 123. Police: 122. Your hotel can also call for emergency assistance — this is often the fastest option.' },
  ],
  luxor: [
    { q: 'Is Luxor safe at night?', a: 'The main Corniche road and hotel areas are safe at night. The West Bank after dark is less recommended without pre-arranged transport. Avoid wandering unfamiliar alleys alone.' },
    { q: 'How do I deal with aggressive vendors in Luxor?', a: 'Say "La shukran" (no thank you) firmly and keep walking without eye contact. Never engage in bargaining you didn\'t initiate. Eye contact and hesitation are interpreted as invitations.' },
    { q: 'Are balloon rides in Luxor safe?', a: 'Only with ECAA (Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority) certified operators. Fatal crashes have occurred with uncertified companies. Do not book on price alone — always verify certification.' },
    { q: 'Is Luxor safe for solo travelers?', a: 'Yes, with the right awareness. Luxor has many solo travelers. The main challenge is the persistent tout culture near temples — manageable with a firm approach and this guide.' },
  ],
  aswan: [
    { q: 'Is Aswan the safest city in Egypt for tourists?', a: 'It\'s widely considered one of the safest. Aswan is smaller, the pace is slower, and Nubian culture is notably more welcoming than other tourist areas. Scams exist but are milder.' },
    { q: 'Do I need a guide in Aswan?', a: 'Not required, but helpful for Abu Simbel\'s historical context. The temples are well-signed. For the Nile, a felucca captain who doubles as a guide is excellent value.' },
    { q: 'Is it safe to travel to Abu Simbel from Aswan?', a: 'Yes, on the official police convoy that departs at 4am. The route and convoy are secure. Do not attempt the drive outside the convoy — it is not permitted.' },
    { q: 'Is Aswan safe for solo female travelers?', a: 'Yes, notably more so than Luxor or Cairo. Aswan\'s Nubian-influenced culture is generally more respectful toward solo women. Standard precautions apply, especially at night.' },
  ],
