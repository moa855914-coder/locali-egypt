  overview: `El Gouna is a privately-owned, purpose-built resort town on the Red Sea coast, 30km north of Hurghada. Often called "The Venice of the Red Sea", it's built across a network of lagoons and islands with crystal-clear water. It's Egypt's most upscale, safe, and well-maintained tourist destination — think clean streets, no haggling, modern infrastructure, and over 100 restaurants. Popular with European expats, kitesurfers, divers, and luxury travelers who want beach life without the chaos of Hurghada.`,
